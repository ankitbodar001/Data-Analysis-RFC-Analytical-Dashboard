# RFM Analysis Dashboard

## Overview
This project demonstrates the creation of an RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) Analysis Dashboard using Python. The dashboard provides visual insights into customer segmentation based on their purchasing behavior. It uses libraries like Dash, Plotly, and Pandas to build an interactive web application.

## Features
- **Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) Analysis**: Calculates RFM scores for customer segmentation.
- **Data Visualization**: Includes bar charts, treemaps, and heatmaps to analyze customer segments.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Features dropdowns to select and display different types of visualizations dynamically.
- **Customer Insights**: Segments customers into categories like "Champions" and "At Risk" based on RFM scores.

## Technology Stack
- **Python Libraries**: Dash, Plotly, Pandas
- **Data Analysis**: Scoring and segmentation based on customer purchasing data
- **Visualization**: Dynamic and interactive visualizations using Plotly and Dash
